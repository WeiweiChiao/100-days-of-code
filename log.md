# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: May30, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp and completed the part of HTML this morning. 

**Thoughts**: This is the second time for me to use FCC since before I learned coding on the CHINESE edition. Althouth it costed more time, I have gotten more results, like the English community, friends from all the world and a feeling of capacity. Also I think there is a great place to record my life experience and thoughts.
One thing more important for is that I can freely communicate with so many people who also have a dream. 
It is a good habit to record your feeling here although you may not have a big harvest.

### Day 2: May 31, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  I have completed all the Basic CSS part on FreeCodeCamp, and I also stick to publishing twitter.

**Thoughts**: This morning my teacher sent me the paper, so I have no as much time as yesterday on programming. I felt fulfilled all day.
